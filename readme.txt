Requires at least: 3.6.0
Tested up to: 4.7.2

== Description ==
With the REEVIOO plugin you can easily integrate REEVIOO's JSON code for showing stars in Google. 



This plugin requires an ID from your reevioo.com account to function. The ID from your REEVIOO acccount will be stored in your Wordpress database. All the other information (such as name, url, reviewscores, best ratings, etc) will be grabbed from your REEVIOO listing page.

PAY ATTENTION: This plugin doesn't show anything in your website. It only adds a piece of code to show stars under your domain name in Google's search results.
